      <h2> This is an H2 </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/53295/10-fascinating-facts-about-ravens" target="_blank">This is a link</a>. Fun facts about Ravens! Did you know they are one of the most, if not the most, intelligent birds to currently exist? Ravens can immitate people similar to parrots can! Actually, they're far more articulate, and can even often make an accurate voice. They can also immitate normal sounds. Sometimes, they'll play actual games together, like dropping sticks out of the sky and trying to catch it before the other can. They even understand how to lie and decieve, often pretending to place their food somewhere to trick another Raven into being misled, and then flying off with the meal in thier beaks. But ravens are so smart, that they don't even get tricked by their own tactic sometimes. </p>
        <p> <a href= "https://www.greekmythology.com/" target= "_blank">This is a link.</a>. Greek mythology is a weird thing. It begins with Gaea and chaos who created the univers and gave birth to many of the Gods. Chaos was then castrated by his children (and his genitals fell into the ocean, creating a foam in the ocean that gave birth to Aphrodite, who's name means sea sperm.) Cronus, the son that castrated Chaos, became the king of the Gods and would swallow his children to prevent them from ever taking his spot. His wife, however, Rhea, (also his sister)  Hid their last son, Zeus. When Zeus grew up, he came back, clapped his dad in the war known as the Titanomanchy, and became the Final king of the Gods. </p>
        <p> <a href= "https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-vikings" target= "_blank">This is a link.</a>. Did you know that vikings actually had really good hygiene? They had better hygiene than their neighbors, the amglo-saxon kingdoms. Vikings would bathe at least twice in one week. Which was far too much compared to the Saxons who bathed once every month or so. Vikings also used beard cream which was really just fats and herbs mixed together, and would keep their hair maintained. Their women also were far more free then their neighbor women. Women in the viking community had rights to property of their own and their own identity. They also had protection against sexual assaults, in most cases. Vikings were cool. Bloody, but cool. </p>
      <h2> This is another H2 </h2>
        <p> This paragraph is italicized. I like to study theology and religion. Fun fact, did you know the bible is practically the only religious text that has sufficient historical evidence behind it? Besides the fact that the book is a literal composed book of historical documents and eye witness accounts, the bible's timeline also tends to be accurate to the history around it. Did you also know that the way Romans crucified people was very cruel and violent? It was a guarenteed way to kill someone off. A very common rebuttal by islamic communities against the death of christ (they often don't believe he died) is that there was absolutely no way for him to live! He would have been flogged and whipped 40 times, beaten to a pulp, carried a wooden cross on his wipped back for a long distance, his arms and legs were pierced with nails; in which to breathe, his body would raise, but would struggle to come back down as it would affect the nails in his body and cause severe pain. </P>
        <p> He would be left their for hours, struggling to breath, bleeding profusely, muscles in his arms practically beaten until they would no longer work, and then after hours- the Romans would come by with a spear and  shove it into his side  to ensure he was dead. They'd pierce just below the left ribcage and into the heart. According to 99% of historians, Jesus was an actual person. And according to 99% of Doctors, he definitely was killed in crucifiction. But he definitely isn't in the tomb that they buried him. Many argue he wasn't put there to begin with, but historical evidence wouldn't agree. Many would argue he was moved from the tomb, but that certainly would've gotten the guards in charge of his tomb killed. It's truly an interesting topic of disucussion. </p>
