    <p class="textright"> The FitnessGram PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
                      <br>The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the FitnessGram assessment.
                      <br>Students run back and forth as many times as they can, each lap signaled by a beep sound.
                      <br>The test get progressively faster as it continues until the student reaches their max lap score.
                      <br>The PACER Test score is combined in the FitnessGram software with scores for muscular strength, endurance, flexibility and body composition to determine whether a student is in the Healthy Fitness Zone™ or the Needs Improvement Zone™.

    <p class="textleft"> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep,
                      <br>and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
                      <br>"And God said, "Let there be light", and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
                      <br>God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night" And there was evening and there was morning-the first day
                      <br>And God said, "let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water." So God made the vault and separated the water under
                      <br>the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the "sky." And there was eening, and there morning-the second day.
                      <br>and you know the rest lol.

    <p class="textcenter"> It is at this point that Aspyn realized her professor had actually been using gibberish to form his paragraphs...she's quite unhappy.
                      <br> She's even beginning to question whether or not thes BR scripts were necessary to use. She's no longer confident in anything she's doing.
                      <br> She already broke her laptop and now all four assignments are late. There goes her streak. This is hopefully not going to hurt her grades
                      <br> TOO bad. Although it will sting. Fun fact, she's currently listening to musicals as shes doing this. They're really good. You should really
                      <br> check them out. This one is "Into The Woods". All the while, her roommate is probably confused.

    <p class="textjustify"> Let me tell you a story of my military experience. This was during my time serving at the captial during the time of the riots-
                      <br> It was about 11 at night when a hispanic woman walks up to the gate. We were used to people coming up to the gate, and cars stopping
                      <br> every now and then to look at us. But when she didn't leave, one of our sergeants walked up to the gate to ask her what she wanted.
                      <br> She had a bag in her hands. She gestured at it, and said "I have a gift for President Biden". That raised a major red flag,
                      <br> and the sergeant commanded she left. She did...after some rebuttal. Later that night, we were sitting in the garages under the capital,
                      <br> as I'm sure you saw on the news- we slept in the basement garages. Anyway, at some point we heard a terrifyingly lound *BANG*, and
                      <br> everyone froze. Those of us who remembered the woman from not an hour earlier, jumped to our feet, grabbed our weapons, and rushed to
                      <br> stairs. After higherups had us come to a halt and investigated, they came back both angry and laughing. Apparently, it was just a
                      <br> really bad car crash lol. The End.
